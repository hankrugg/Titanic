# Kaggle Titanic

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that tackles the **Kaggle Titanic competition**, where the goal is to predict passenger survival using machine learning.

## Overview
The **Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster** competition is a Kaggle challenge that requires predicting survival outcomes based on passenger data, including features like age, class, and gender.

## Results
- Best model achieved **79% accuracy** on the testing set using Random Forest.
- A detailed video describing my solution is available here https://youtu.be/ku0j9wBQkOw?si=UjRZt_mgcewjEbuR 

## Future Improvements
- Try **Deep Learning (Neural Networks)** for better results.  
- Use **Stacking or Ensemble Learning** to combine multiple models.
